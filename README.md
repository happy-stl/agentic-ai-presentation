## About the Presentation

The presentation covers the paradigm shift in software engineering towards intelligent, autonomous systems. It delves into practical strategies for leveraging Agentic AI to enhance development workflows, improve code quality, and accelerate project timelines.

### Key Topics Covered:

*   **Introduction to Agentic AI**: Understanding the move from traditional automation to intelligent, autonomous systems.
*   **Prompt Engineering**: Best practices for creating effective prompts to guide AI models.
*   **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: A universal standard for connecting AI systems with external tools and data sources.
*   **The Evolution of Claude Models**: An analysis of the significant performance leap from Claude 3.5 to Claude 4.0.
*   **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Using TDD as an evolutionary fitness function to guide AI code generation.
*   **Hybrid AI Architectures**: Combining the strengths of Large Language Models (LLMs) and classical AI for robust solutions.

## Development Process

This presentation was developed using an Agentic AI-driven workflow:

*   **Initial Research & Design**: Conducted using [Perplexity.ai](https://www.perplexity.ai/).
*   **Code Implementation & Refinement**: Done with the assistance of [Cursor AI](https://cursor.sh/).

The code in this repository is a practical example of the concepts discussed in the presentation.
